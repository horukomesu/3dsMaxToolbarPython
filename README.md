# 3ds Max Toolbar Python Tools

This repository contains helper scripts for the custom 3dsÂ Max toolbar.  
A small auto-update module is provided to keep the scripts in sync with the
GitHub repository.

## Auto-updater

The module `autoupdater.py` can be imported and used to automatically check
for new versions of this repository on GitHub. By default it checks the
`main` branch of the repository specified in the module constants. The
function returns `True` when an update has been installed and accepts an
optional callback for progress reporting.

```
import autoupdater
autoupdater.check_for_updates()
```

During an update all files and folders in the project directory are replaced
with the contents of the repository except for the updater itself and the
log file. Missing files are restored automatically on each start. The current
commit hash is stored in the file `VERSION` and all actions are logged to
`update.log`.

`ToolbarMain.py` performs this check automatically on startup and shows a
progress dialog when downloading an update. If an update is installed the
script is restarted.

Edit the constants `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `BRANCH` and `VERSION_FILE`
inside `autoupdater.py` to point to the desired repository and version file.
